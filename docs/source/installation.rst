Installation
===========================================

Scaffold is installed like any other Django app::

    ?>easy_install django-scaffold
    
or, preferably::

    ?>pip install django-scaffold

place the scaffold package where python can find it and then add it to the list of apps in the INSTALLED_APPS setting of your `settings.py` file.
